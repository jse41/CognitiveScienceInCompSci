# Independent Study Check-In 

## Explored this week

- Embodiment 
  - Tendon Driven Robotics 
- Boltzmann Machines
  - A recurrent Neural Network 
  - Very difficult and slow to train 
  - Similar in that it contains a memory 
- Really struggled with the idea of intelligence 
  - What is intelligence?
  - Do crows have intelligence?
  - It seems very embodied. 
  - Intelligence tests seem deeply flawed 
- Framing 
  - Is an extension of embodiment 
  - Looking into application in Computer Science to find frame recognition used in image recognition 
  - really ended up struggling with the difference between knowing associations and actually understanding them 
    - What is an understanding? 
- Humor 
  - Borat 

## Things that puzzled me

- I don't know if I'll find an answer, but trying to figure out how understanding works. 
  - More of the neuroscience of memory and decision making 
- I want to look more into conceptual metaphor theory 
- Humor, seeing where these complexities come from 



Add to intelligence about what it really means 

## Things I'm going to look into going forward 

- Neuroscience of memory 
- Mark Johnson and Conceptual Metaphor Theory 
- How learning happens in the brain 
- Exploration into Boltsmann machines publisher 
- *Qualia* look in to it 
  - Nagals 
  - What's it like to be a bat?
