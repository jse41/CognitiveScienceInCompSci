# The Intersections of Cognitive Science and Computer Science 
By Jacob Engelbrecht

*These Questions and Responses will evolve over the course of this project*

## So what does Cognitive Science have to do with Computer Science? 
All systems have some component of human interaction related to them, whether that be being designed to interact with, aid, or replicate some human function. How they are able to do this, or how one would do this like a human, is where the field of Cognitive Science is crucial. Cognitive Science strives to break down the mysteries of cognition into frameworks, models, and relations that root our understanding. The better these are understood, the better interactions between humans and systems will be. 

## Will AI be as smart as humans? 
There are some things Artificial Intelligences are already far better at than the human mind, but nothing quite as well versed with the variety of concepts understood by humans. For a system to truly logic like a human, it would need the experience of growing up like a human, constantly learning and experiencing new things and interactions. One of my favorite analogies I read was that humans created machines that fly through the sky, but they don't look like birds. Maybe AI is the same in that vein that we are designed something that will accomplish our desired tasks, but it doesn't look like what nature came up with.
